# Augmented and Virtual Reality - Project #1 - Space8
First project for Augmented and Virtual Reality course. <br/>
The project is an immersive experience where the user begins in an empty space and has only a xylophone together with a drumstick. The melodies that can be played with these cause spawn of stars, planets and asteroids. Tone of the sounds and intervals between them determine the kind of object that appears. Besides spawning, the player can also roam freely through the space and witness how everything that is already created behaves.<br/>
Everything is done in Unity and uses C# for scripting. <br/>
In terms of technologies, Samsung Gear VR was used and is the tool compatible to run the project.
